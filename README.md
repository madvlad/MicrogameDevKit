- Template demonstrate different ways one might utilize the touchscreen to make a game
- Everything is royalty free or original

# Structure
The top level of the repo will be a list of folders for all the templates. Each template is a standalone Unity solution.

# To make
- Basic poke game (like a balloon poping game)
